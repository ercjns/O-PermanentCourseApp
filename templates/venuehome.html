<h1>Orienteering at {{ venue }}</h1>
<h3>What is Orienteering?</h3>
	<p> Orienteering chellenges people of every age to find their way through a set of checkpoints using only a map and compass.
		Cascade Orienteering Club has set up a permanent course here at {{ venue }} which you can try out right now.
		You'll use your phone to view an orienteering-style map and will skip the compass for now.
		In city parks many orienteers skip using a compass becuase there are so many unique features to help orient the map.
		What are you waiting for? <a href={{ url_for('init_course', venue=venue, course=1) }}>Try it out!</a>
<h3>Try it out now!</h3>
	<p> {{ venue }} has 3 pre-set courses. We suggest you start with the beginner course, and try the others if you have time. :)
